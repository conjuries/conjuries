Some useful javascript client routines to do adaptable displays, popnotes and endnotes, as well as complete encryption for the people: RSA and AES. Also: helper routines for base64, actual random number generation and so on.

The RSA stack is clean and (nearly!) clear: intuit a bit of number theory and you can follow it...

Some server-side code in PHP is included, for use and/or illustration.

NOTE that some of these routines are incompatible with Internet Explorer, 9 and below.

Most recently, routines to define polynomials and solve multivariate polynomial equations numerically have been added.

Software is actually under MPL 2, rather than (as it says) 1.1.
